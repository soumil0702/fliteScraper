if your xpath starts with a '*' it means we are not specifying a particular element like input, button,etc , we are specifying all elements in  the page

Using Spreadsheets API:
Follow the video properly from Twilio on youtube in my playlist. make sure to grant access to both gdrive and spreadsheets

Some simple commands:
scope= ['https://spreadsheets.google.com/feeds', 'https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive']
creds=ServiceAccountCredentials.from_json_keyfile_name('client_secret.json',scope)
client=gspread.authorize(creds)
sheet=client.open('flitescraper').sheet1
#pp=pprint.PrettyPrinter()
#result=sheet.get_all_records();
#pp.pprint(result)

#result=sheet.row_values(4) #comment this its only for printing row contents of row 3
#result=sheet.col_values(3)
#sheet.update_cell(7,10,3)
#result=(sheet.cell(7,10).value)+'Jheezy'

#to add your own row:
row=["I'm", "updating", "a ", "sheet","using", "pythonning"]
index=90;
#sheet.insert_row(row,index)
#sheet.delete_row(3)
sheet.update_cell(2,10,strftime("%H:%M - %d-%m-%Y" ))
print(sheet.row_count)
